% - General statement introducing the area; You can most likely start with the first paragraph from your project description and evolve it.
% - Explanation of the specific problem and why do we care about the problem.
% - Explanation of your solution, and how it improves on the work by others. Relation to related work can be very brief, given that you have a separate extensive section devoted to this.
%  -A hint on how the solution was evaluated and what was the outcome of this evaluation.
%  -A summary (a “map”) of how the paper is organized.

\section{Introduction}
Voronoi diagrams have been know for... In YYYY Fortune invented the algorithm for ... They are interesting because this and that. Get examples from \url{http://voronoi.com/wiki/index.php?title=Voronoi_Applications } We use restaurants, defined as sites.

Various interesting questions could be asked about the diagram, that would also pose of interest in algorithm design. In which cell does a given point reside? Which cell is the largest? The questions are not jsut interest for the algorithmic challange, but also due to how we can interpret the answer to such questions in relation to the sites that composit the diagram. E.g. we could assume that if a given
