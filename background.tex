\section{Background}

Basic description of voronoi diagrams and the algortihm. Refer to the book, but explain running time of Fortune vs slap approach and single shot. Describe circle events, how they end up and get pulled from the event queue and why they are important - segments are generated and we want to add them to the map when taht happens.

Trapezoidal map. Maybe a bit more fine grained explanation. Refer to book for full detail, a few visual examples.
