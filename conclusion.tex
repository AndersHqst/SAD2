\section{Conclusion}
We have outlined the main ideas behind Fortunes algorithm for generating Voronoi diagrams, and an algorithm for generating trapezoidal maps. The solution provided demonstrates how this can be done and we have discussed a few central challanges in implementing the algorithm. Once we understand the underpinnings of the two algorithms, making them work in combination is almost trivial and we have a point location time in O(logn). The we have presented is implemented in a generic fashion and it should be easy to see the solution used on top of other data sets.

The initial problem of merging the two algorithms turned out to be a bit easier than first anticipated. However, to come to this conclusion, we had to study the algorithms properly and while still having time to make the implementation.
