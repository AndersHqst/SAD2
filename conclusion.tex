\section{Conclusion}
We have shown the design of two algorithms in the field of computational geometry. We found that altering the the Fortune algorithm to return a fast search data structure of a trapezoidal map for point location was indeed feasible, and showed that by querying random points at the datastructure we could reason about which cell is the biggest. The algorithms presented are implemented in a generic fashion and it should be easy to see the solution used on top of another any other data set.
