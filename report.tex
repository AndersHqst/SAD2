\begin{abstract}
Voronoi diagrams are used in a variety of contexts in mathematics, biology and computing to name a few. We are interested in analysing the composition of the voronoi diagram, as to say something interesting about the underlying data. In this paper we descibe have a data set containing the geographical location of a handful of fastfood restaurants can be analysed when representing them in a voronoi diagram. In particular, we provide background and solution for performing point location in a voronoi diagram by altering an existing open-source solution for generating the voronoi diagram, with our own implementation of trapezoidal map algorithm, to be able to perform point location in O(log n) time. The motivation for this is to be able to answer what fast-food restaurants a given set of geographical points, or maybe customers, are closest to. Secondly, we provide an analysis of the expected number of custmers that will end in the bigget voronoi cell when distributed randomly across the fast-food restaurant diagram. We find that such information querying on the target data set, could be of potential interest when dealing with location planning of new restaurants, or analysing customer behavior.
